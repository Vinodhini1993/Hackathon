#  IoT Based Smart Assistive Device for Pain Detection and Management

##  Introduction
<p align="justify">
People with disabilities benefit greatly from prosthetic legs, which enable them restore their freedom and movement in day-to-day activities. An essential part of these prosthetic limbs is the liner, which is typically composed of silicone and acts as a barrier between the user's residual limb and the artificial leg. But because the liner rubs against the skin, a person may feel uncomfortable when they first start wearing a prosthetic leg. The bones and muscles of the residual limb may become irritated and under more pressure as a result of this friction. The user may find it difficult to use the prosthetic comfortably for prolonged periods of time as a result of the intense pain that this pressure can eventually produce. The user may need to experiment with various liners or accessories as they get used to the prosthetic leg.


##  Overview
<p align="justify">
The aim of this system is to evaluate the adaptability of assistive devices, particularly prosthetic legs, to improve the comfort and functionality for the user. By providing real-time data access, this system enhances the accessibility and user experience of the prosthetic leg. It works in collaboration with an occupational therapist to increase the durability of the device and includes a pain monitoring system that tracks and assesses the discomfort caused by wearing the prosthetic leg. Through continuous real-time data monitoring and feedback, the system enables adaptive pain management, offering personalized adjustments to minimize discomfort. The collected data is analyzed and visualized, giving both the user and healthcare professionals valuable insights to ensure a more comfortable and effective prosthetic experience. This approach helps improve the overall quality of life for prosthetic leg users, addressing both physical and emotional needs.
