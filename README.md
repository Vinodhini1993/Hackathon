People with disabilities benefit greatly from prosthetic legs, which enable them restore their freedom and movement in day-to-day activities. An essential part of these prosthetic limbs is the liner, which is typically composed of silicone and acts as a barrier between the user's residual limb and the artificial leg. But because the liner rubs against the skin, a person may feel uncomfortable when they first start wearing a prosthetic leg. The bones and muscles of the residual limb may become irritated and under more pressure as a result of this friction. The user may find it difficult to use the prosthetic comfortably for prolonged periods of time as a result of the intense pain that this pressure can eventually produce. The user may need to experiment with various liners or accessories as they get used to the prosthetic leg.
